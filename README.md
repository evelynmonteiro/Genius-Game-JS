## 🔎 About the Project

This repository was created in response to the proposed project / challenge within the Digital Innovation One platform.

I made some changes visually and mainly in the way the game works. I put a button so that the user could start the game and also a scoreboard.

### 📌 New Features and Improvements List

- Start button
